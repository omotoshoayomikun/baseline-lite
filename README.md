# Baseline Lite (VS Code Extension)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

A Visual Studio Code extension that integrates [Web Platform Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline/) data directly into your editor.  
It highlights CSS, HTML, and JavaScript/TypeScript features that are **not yet universally supported**, helping developers adopt modern features confidently without breaking production.

## üöÄ Overview
As web developers, we often hesitate before using a new property, attribute, or API: *‚ÄúIs it safe to use yet?‚Äù*  
Normally, you‚Äôd have to check MDN, caniuse.com, or blog posts. This extension removes that friction by surfacing **Baseline compatibility guidance inline while you code.**

- ‚úÖ Inline badges show Baseline status (Limited / Newly / Widely).  
- ‚úÖ Problems panel entries with severity (Warnings for Limited, Info for Newly).  
- ‚úÖ Hover tooltips with feature details and MDN links.  
- ‚úÖ Works with **CSS, HTML, JS/TS, and React (JSX/TSX)**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Inline Baseline Badges**  
  Displays `Baseline: Limited` or `Baseline: Newly` at the end of the line, with hover details.

- **Problems Panel Integration**  
  Findings appear in the Problems panel with proper severity. Clickable *MDN* links go straight to documentation.

- **Language Coverage**  
  - CSS: properties, values, at-rules, pseudos  
  - HTML: tags, attributes, attribute values  
  - JS/TS: Web APIs (`navigator.clipboard`, `AbortController`, etc.)  
  - React: JSX/TSX (via JS/TS analysis)

- **Configurable Presentation**  
  Choose how to view results:  
  - Diagnostics (Problems panel only)  
  - Decorations (inline badges only)  
  - Both (default)

- **Status Bar Summary**  
  Quick counts of Limited and Newly findings in the current file.
